        /*Create a class that captures students. Each student has a first name, last name, class year, and major. Create two examples of students.

        Create a class that captures planets. Each planet has a name, a distance from the sun, and its gravity relative to Earthâ€™s gravity.
        For distance and gravity, use the type double which captures real numbers. Make objects for Earth and your favorite non-earth planet.

        Create classes that capture bank customers and bank accounts. A customer has a first and last name.
        An account has a customer and a balance. Make objects for two accounts held by the same customer.

        Create a class that captures airline tickets. Each ticket lists the departure and arrival cities, a flight number, and a seat assignment
        . A seat assignment has both a row and a letter for the seat within the row (such as 12F). Make two examples of tickets.*/
